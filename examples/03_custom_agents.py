Example 03 — Custom agents

A *custom agent* is a named persona you bundle with the session: a system
prompt, an allowlist of tools, and a description. The model can be told
to "act as" one of them and is restricted to that agent's toolset.

This demo defines two agents in the same session and switches between
them mid-conversation:

    researcher  → answers questions about the codebase, never edits
    reviewer    → critiques a file for bugs / clarity

Concepts covered:
  * Declaring multiple agents via `custom_agents=[...]`
  * Picking the initial agent with `agent="..."`
  * Listing registered personas with `session.rpc.agent.list()`
  * Inspecting the active persona with `session.rpc.agent.get_current()`
  * Switching agents at runtime with `session.rpc.agent.select(...)`

Run:
    python examples/03_custom_agents.py

# Each agent is a plain dict. The most important keys are:
#   name        → identifier you use to select the agent later
#   prompt      → the system prompt that shapes its behaviour
#   tools       → built-in tool names this agent is *allowed* to use
#                 (`grep`, `glob`, `view`, `bash`, `write`, ...)
#   description → shown to the model when listing available agents
